            <strong>Mount Fuji</strong> (富士山, Fujisan, Japanese: [ɸɯꜜ(d)ʑisaɴ] (listen)), 
            or Fugaku, located on the island of Honshū, is the highest mountain in Japan, 
            with a summit elevation of 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft 3 in). It is the second-highest 
            volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra),
             and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth. Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano 
             that last erupted from 1707 to 1708. The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) 
             southwest of Tokyo and is visible from there on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally 
             symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, 
             is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently depicted in 
             art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers and climbers.
        </p>

            Mount Fuji is one of Japan's "Three Holy Mountains" (三霊山, Sanreizan) 
            along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is a Special Place of Scenic Beauty 
            and one of Japan's Historic Sites. It was added to the World Heritage List as a 
            Cultural Site on June 22, 2013. According to UNESCO, Mount Fuji has 
            "inspired artists and poets and been the object of pilgrimage for centuries". 
            UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. 
            These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, 
            Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha.
