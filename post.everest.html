            <strong>Mount Everest</strong> (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: Sagarmāthā; 
            Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng) 
            is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, 
            located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. 
            The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.
            Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031.7 ft) was most recently 
            established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.

            Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. 
            There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast 
            in Nepal (known as the "standard route") and the other from the north in Tibet.
            While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, 
            Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as 
            hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. 
            As of 2019, over 300 people have died on Everest, 
            many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.

            The first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by 
            British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter 
            the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the 
            north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first 
            reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) 
            on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up 
            to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed 
            above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924 expedition resulted in one 
            of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: 
            George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt 
            on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether 
            they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and 
            Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest 
            in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had 
            reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a 
            member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering 
            team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first 
            reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge 
            on 25 May 1960.
