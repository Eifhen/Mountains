            <strong>K2</strong>, at 8,611 metres (28,251 ft) above sea level,
             is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest
              (at 8,849 metres (29,032 ft)). It lies in the Karakoram range, 
              partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered 
              Kashmir and partially in a China-administered territory of the Kashmir 
              region included in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.
        </p>
        <p>
            K2 also became popularly known as the Savage Mountain after George Bell—a climber 
            on the 1953 American expedition—told reporters, 
            "It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you."
            Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 is the deadliest; 
            approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who 
            reach the summit.
            Also occasionally known as Mount Godwin-Austen, other nicknames for 
            K2 are The King of Mountains and The Mountaineers' Mountain, as well 
            as The Mountain of Mountains after prominent Italian climber 
            Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers 
            Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni, on the 1954 Italian 
            expedition led by Ardito Desio. In January 2021, K2 became the final 
            eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was 
            accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja 
            and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa. <br> <br>

            K2 is the only 8,000+ metre peak that has never been climbed from its eastern face.
            Ascents have almost always been made in July and August, which are typically the warmest 
            times of the year; K2's more northern location makes it more susceptible 
            to inclement and colder weather. The peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges. 
            Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult 
            and dangerous climb, due in part to its more inclement weather. 
            As of February 2021, only 377 people have completed the ascent to its summit. 
            There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs, according to the list maintained 
            on the list of deaths on eight-thousanders.
